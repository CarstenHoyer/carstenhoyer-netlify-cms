Creative Coding Copenhagen (CCC) is a community of creative people, who have a shared interest in explorative technology based art and creativity. I started CCC in the fall of 2018 with a talk by Andreas Refsgaard. In 2019 our focus has been on open code nights, and slowly building up the community feeling. We are now a small handful of organizers.
